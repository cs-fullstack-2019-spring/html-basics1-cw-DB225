    <h2 class="change">My history</h2>
    <p>
        I was born in Ivory Coast and after my highSchool Diploma, I went in Moscow (Russia) for studies.
        I was a little bit scared about to go somewhere else because I was very young and I never lived alone.
        So it was difficult to me to adapt to it but after a few months, I found my way to live better.
        I received my bachelor degree after 4 years. I began a master degree but I finally join the United States.
        Now I'm a student of CodeCrew Codde School.
