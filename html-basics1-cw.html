    <h2 class="changeAgain">History</h2>
    <p class="change">
        Occupying a substantial bluff rising from the Mississippi River, the site of Memphis has been a natural location for human settlement by varying cultures over thousands of years.
        The area was known to be settled in the first millennium A.D. by people of the Mississippian Culture, who had a network of communities throughout the Mississippi River Valley and its tributaries.
        They built complexes with large earthwork ceremonial and burial mounds as expressions of their sophisticated culture.

        J.D.L. Holmes, writing in Hudson's Four Centuries of Southern Indians (2007), notes that this site was a third strategic point in the late 18th century through which European powers could control United States encroachment and their interference with Indian matters—after Fort Nogales (present day Vicksburg) and Fort Confederación (present day Epes, Alabama): "...Chickasaw Bluffs, located on the Mississippi River at the present-day location of Memphis.
        Spain and the United States vied for control of this site, which was a favorite of the Chickasaws.

    <h3 ><em>19th century</em></h3>
    <p class="change">
        The city of Memphis was founded on May 22, 1819 (incorporated December 19, 1826) by John Overton, James Winchester and Andrew Jackson.
        They named it after the ancient capital of Egypt on the Nile River.
        Memphis developed as a trade and transportation center in the 19th century because of its flood-free location high above the Mississippi River.
        Located in the low-lying delta region along the river, its outlying areas were developed as cotton plantations, and the city became a major cotton market and brokerage center.

    <p class="change">
        The cotton economy of the antebellum South depended on the forced labor of large numbers of African-American slaves, and Memphis also developed as a major slave market for the domestic slave trade.
        Through the early 19th century, one million slaves were transported from the Upper South, in a huge forced migration to newly developed plantation areas in the Deep South.
        Many were transported by steamboats along the Ohio and Mississippi rivers.
        In 1857, the Memphis and Charleston Railroad was completed, connecting the Atlantic Coast of South Carolina and this major Mississippi River port; it was the only east-west railroad constructed across the southern states prior to the Civil War.
        This gave planters and cotton brokers access to the Atlantic Coast for shipping cotton to England, a major market.

    <h3><em>Postwar years, Reconstruction and Democratic control</em></h3>
    <p class="change">
        The rapid demographic changes, added to the stress of war and occupation, and uncertainty about who was in charge, resulted in growing tensions between the Irish policemen and black Union soldiers following the war.
        In three days of rioting in early May 1866, the Memphis Riot erupted, in which white mobs made up of policemen, firemen, and other mostly ethnic Irish Americans, attacked and killed 46 blacks, wounding 75 and injuring 100 persons; raped several women, and destroyed nearly 100 houses while severely damaging churches and schools in South Memphis.
        Much of the black settlement was left in ruins. Two whites were killed in the riot.
        Many blacks permanently fled Memphis after the riot, especially as the Freedmen's Bureau continued to have difficulty in protecting them.
        Their population fell to about 15,000 by 1870,[28] or 37.4% of the city, which then had a total population of 40,226.(See census table in Demographics section.)
    </p>
    <p class="change">
        Historian Barrington Walker suggests that the Irish rioted against blacks because of their relatively recent arrival as immigrants and the uncertain nature of their own claim to "whiteness"; they were trying to separate themselves from blacks in the underclass.
        The main fighting participants were ethnic Irish, decommissioned black Union soldiers, and newly emancipated freedmen from the African-American community.
        Walker suggests that most of the mob were not in direct economic conflict with the blacks, as by then the Irish had attained better jobs, but the Irish were establishing dominance over the freedmen.
